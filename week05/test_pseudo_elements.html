            A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific 
            part of the selected element(s). 
            For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.
        </p>
        <div>
            The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container. The float property can have one of the following values:
- left - The element floats to the left of its container
- right - The element floats to the right of its container
- none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
- inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
- left - The element floats to the left of its container
- right - The element floats to the right of its container
- none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
- inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
        </div>

                This is a somewhat long HTML
paragraph that will be broken into several
lines. The first line will be identified
by a fictional tag sequence. The other lines
will be treated as ordinary lines in the
paragraph.
